# ðŸ“Œ tack

tack is just a place to stick things that are needed cross-project. It is not meant to be a big/professional library like lodash. Instead, it contains useful utilities and algorithms we commonly need with boilerplate so we don't need to waste a bunch of time configuring rollup for each little module. Instead, the modules all house together in this package, and thanks to treeshaking, we can still load only what we need.

## api

### `assert(condition: any, message?: string): void;`

Throw an assertion error with the given message if the condition is not true.

### `findLast<T>(predicate: (it: T, index: number) => boolean, array: any[]): T;`

Find the last item of an array that matches the predicate.

### `head<T>(it: Iterable<T>): T;`

Return the first item of an iterable.

### `partition<T>(predicate: (item: T, index: number) => boolean, array: T[]): [T[], T[]];`

Split an array into two arrays, ones that respectively contain all the items matching and not matching the predicate.

### `class TopologicalSort<T>`

#### `nodes: Set<T>;`

Just a set of nodes. Manage this yourself using its `Set` api.

#### `addEdge(source: T, target: T): void;`

Add an edge from the source to the target.

#### `sort(): T[];`

Get a sorted list of nodes.
